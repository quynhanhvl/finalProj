Objective: The objective of this program is to calculate the exam grade student needs for the grade they want.

Algorithm:
    - introduce people to the calculator 
    - ask for current grade 
    - asked for desired grade
    - ask for what the final is worth
    - take the final weight and subtract 100
    - take current grade and multiply by (100 - final weight)
    - take goal and subtract (current(100- final weight))
    - divide by final weight
    - state course and grade needed
    - give a short message

Pseudocode:
# print statement welcoming users
# state purpose of program
# state how to start program


    # if userChoice="s"
    # contCalculating is true
    # start while loop for when contCalculating is true

    # course = input(ask for course)
    # goal = int(input(ask for goal))
    # current = int(input(ask for current grade))
    # weight = int(input(ask for the final exam weight))
    
    #def a function called gradeNeeded()
        # val1 = 1-weight
        # val2 = current*val1
        # val3 = goal-val2
        # val4 = val3/weight
        #return calculation 
    #result = calls the function
    #print(course) to let user know which course
    #print(result)
        
    #if (result is less than 30):
            #print("provide message")
        #elif (result is less than 70):
            print("message")
        #elif (result result is less than 80):
            print("message")
        #elif (result result is less than 100):
            print("message")
        #else:
            print("message")
        
    #ask if user wants to continue
    
    #if user does not want to continue
        #print statement thanking user
        #break loop
